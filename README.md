"Weekend Projects"
Meditation app
Jan 20th, 2020


This application allows a user to select from 3 predefined time durations (2/5/10) minutes.

Which will then be displayed below the 'Play'/'Pause' button.

Upon clicking on the play button the selected timer will begin to count down, with this
a progress bar will fill in around the play button at the respective rate needed for each duration of time.

In the background a user will either be presented with a video of rain or waves at the beach.
Each of the videos is accompanied by their respective sounds.
A user is able to toggle between the two video background by selecting either of the two buttons
on the right side of the page, which display rain clouds or a sun.

A user is able to pause the counter, at which time the current time will stop as well as the
audio track, however the background video will continue to loop.



Objective:

          During this portion of "weekend projects", I am re-familiarizing myself with
          HTML/CSS/Vanilla Js syntax. And slowly aiding in additional libraries, and functionalities
          with each project.

          As someone who enjoys meditation/ having a break from programming throughout the day I wanted
          to create a simple app which provides users with timer accompanied by ambient noise and
          relaxing visuals that they could relax to, which was the inspiration for this quick project.
